One morning, I woke up really bored.

I was sooo bored that I decided to write a morse code raw PCM generator in perl.

This is the result of that morning.  It is dumb to do it this way, but it is a good intro to writing raw PCM audio.

Look at the comments of the code for an intro on how to run it.
